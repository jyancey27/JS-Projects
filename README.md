# JS-Projects

!! This is for learning purposes and showcasing how I can improve existing projects !!  
Each folder contains a different JavaScript project that I have done.  
Some are through tutorial videos, tutorial websites, and on my own.  

## Use

Each can be ran by using a server, I use live server on VSCode.  

## TODO

Add env file for path and hide some things with .git
