This is a basic memory game for the user to play.  

## Source

I used this link: [Memory Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk&list=WL&index=2)  

## ToDo's

ToDo: center project, add localStorage, display better stats like average tries per game, worst game, and high score, only reset score if you have over 120 matches(10 games played)  
Give the user 10 games to get highest score, always display number of perfect games, average tries per game, and worst game as box below, make it so the is not an alert and instead wait between two clicks,
Lastly import card array
